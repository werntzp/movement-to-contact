Find, fix and destroy the enemy.

Movement to contact is a type of offensive operation designed to develop the situation and establish or regain contact (http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-90/ch4.htm). A commander conducts this type of offensive operation when the tactical situation is not clear or when the enemy has broken contact.
