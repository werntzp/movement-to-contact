    <string name="mtc">Movement to contact is a type of offensive operation designed to develop the situation and establish or regain contact. A commander conducts this type of offensive operation when the tactical situation is not clear or when the enemy has broken contact. A properly executed movement to contact develops the combat situation and maintains the commander\'s freedom of action after contact is gained. This flexibility is essential in maintaining the initiative.</string>
