<h2>What does "Movement to Contact" mean?</h2>
Movement to contact is a type of offensive operation designed to develop the situation and establish or regain contact.
A commander conducts this type of offensive operation when the tactical situation is not clear or when the enemy has broken contact.
A properly executed movement to contact develops the combat situation and maintains the commander's freedom of action after contact is gained.

<h2>How to Play</h2>
In Movement to Contact (M2C), you are a US Army Company Commander tasked with finding and engaging the enemy units in your sector. Your goal is to defeat them as quickly as possible with minimal losses on your side.
Your company consists of three rifle platoons, one additional machine gun team, a mortar section and headquarters element. Each unit has different values for moving and attacking. Each unit also has a combat effectiveness
(from green to black). Once a unit reaches black, it essentially becomes comabt ineffective and can no longer move or attack for the remainder of the game. Units can sometimes be suppressed which means they can not move or fire, but that is temporary
and only lasts for two turns.
<p></p>
Your enemy is a mixture of small infantry squads, machine gun teams and snipers. Each enemy unit will react to you differently (some are more aggressive than others). Unfortunately, you will not know exactly what strength each enemy
unit is at, and many times they are able to blend into the terrain and disappear from your view. The enemy units are randomly generated every game including initial starting points and aggressiveness.
<p></p>
The terrain is a mix of scrub, patches of woods and rocky terrain. Each terrain type has a movement cost; it is easiest to move through scrub and toughest in the rocky areas. In addition, you get a defensive bonus if being
attacked while in the woods or rocky terrain. The map is also randomly generated each game.
<p></p>
M2C is broken into turns during which you and the Opposing Force (OpFor) get to move and attack. Each turn you can move your units until they run out of move points and each unit can attack once. Once you have finished everything
you want to do on your turn, press the "End Turn" button and the Opfor will go. Once the computer has finished, the turn ends and you will start the next turn.
<p></p>
Anytime you want to start a new game, you can go back to the home screen. M2C will automatically save the game at the end of each turn or when you return to the home screen so you can always resume any
game in progress when you return.
