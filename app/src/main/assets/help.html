<h2>Your Mission</h2>
You are a US Army Company Commander tasked with finding, engaging and destroying the enemy units in your sector in support of a larger Battalion attack.&nbsp;
If this sector is not controlled before the main attack, it will allow the enemy to use it as an escape route or to disrupt the main attack from the flanks.&nbsp;
<p></p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
The game is twenty-five turns long with each turn consists of two phases, one where you move and attack with your units, and another when the enemy does the same. The game ends when (1) all the enemy
units have been destroyed, (2) you no longer have any combat effective units or (3) the twenty-five turn limit has been reached. If you go back to the main screen during a game or switch
to another app on your device, the current game will be saved allowing you to resume it later.
<p></p>
<h2>Units</h2>
Your company consists of three rifle platoons, a machine gun team, a mortar section and headquarters element. Each unit has different values for moving and attacking &nbsp;
along with a combat effectiveness rating (from green to black). As your units take casualties, they will lose combat effectiveness and drop from green to yellow to red and finally black.&nbsp;
Once a unit reaches black, it essentially becomes comabt ineffective and can no longer move or attack for the remainder of the game.&nbsp;
Units can sometimes be suppressed which means they can not move or fire, but that is temporary and only lasts for two turns. While a unit is suppressed, its icon is greyed out.
Suppressed units are also more susceptible to taking casualties.
<p></p>
<b>Unit details:</b>
<uL>
<li>Infantry platoons and squads can only attack adjacent enemy units and do not cause any suppression.</li>
<li>Machine gun teams can fire at enemies two squares away, and have a 50% chance of suppressing a unit when they hit them.</li>
<li>Mortars can fire at enemies five squares away, and can also fire into any square to conduct "recon by fire". Mortars automatically suppress a unit if they hit them.</li>
<li>Snipers can fire at you up to four squares away, and automatically supress units when they hit them.</li>
<li>The headquarters element can "see" enemy units two squares away and remove suppression from an any adjacent unit at the end of your turn.</li>

</uL>
<p></p>
<h2>Terrain</h2>
The map terrain is made up of scrub (relatively open areas), woods and rocky terrain. Units in woods or rocky terrain gain an advantage on defense, but both cost more to move into than scrub.
<p></p>
<h2>Fog of War</h2>
While you get an estimate of how many enemy units there are at the beginning of the game, that number is not exact. You also will not know when your units have caused casualties or suppressed enemies.&nbsp;
Also, when visible enemy units are not adjacent to your units (or within two squares of your headquarters) they may be able to blend back into the terrain and disappear off the map.
<p></p>
<h2>Notes, Tips and Strategies</h2>
<ul>
<li>While your company is always the same (composition and starting location), the terrain changes each game, along with exact number and type of enemy units and how aggressive they are.</li>
<li>Since your suppressed units have a higher chance of taking casualties, try to get your headquarters element adjacent to them before the turn ends.</li>
<li>On the flip side, use your mortars to suppress enemy units first and then pound them with infantry to inflict high damage.</li>
    <li>Once a unit attacks, they aren't able to move anymore that turn so plan ahead on where you want units to end up.</li>
<li>While speed is of the essence, don't spread your units too far out so they are unable to quickly support each other.</li>
<li>Keep an eye on the map, as your mortars and heavy machine guns can't travel through rocky terrain so don't let them get cut off from supporting the infantry.</li>
<li>Long press on terrain or a unit icon to get additional information.</li>
<li>Long press on the status text to see a history of all game activity.</li>
</ul>
